| investments | FULL | READ | READ (basic stats) | NONE |
| transactions | FULL | READ (no tokens) | NONE | NONE |
| wallets | FULL | READ | NONE | NONE |
| projects | FULL | READ | READ (public info) | NONE |

## üö® Error Handling Examples

### Access Denied Responses:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "As a support agent, you can only ask basic questions about users and projects. Try asking about user verification status or project information.",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-22T10:30:00Z",
  "role_limitation": true
}
```

### Audit Logging:

Every query is logged with:
- User ID and role
- Query type and content
- Access result (success/denied/error)
- Execution time and tokens used
- Data accessed (tables/columns/row count)

This ensures complete traceability and security compliance.
