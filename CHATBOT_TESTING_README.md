# ü§ñ Chatbot Testing Guide
## Complete Testing Manual for Real Estate Investment Platform

---

## üìã **OVERVIEW**

This guide provides comprehensive testing instructions for the AI chatbot system integrated with role-based access control. The chatbot supports different user roles with varying levels of access to platform data.

### **System Architecture:**
- **Backend API**: Node.js/Express server (port 3000)
- **AI Service**: Python Flask service (port 5001)  
- **Database**: MySQL with role-based permissions
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with role validation

---

## üöÄ **QUICK START**

### **1. Start Services:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm start
# Should show: Server running on port 3000

# Terminal 2: Start AI Service  
cd AI
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_app.py
# Should show: AI service running on port 5001
```

### **2. Verify Services:**
```bash
# Check backend health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Check AI service health
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health
```

### **3. Get Authentication Tokens:**
```bash
# Login as different roles to get JWT tokens
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "superadmin@example.com", "password": "password"}'
```

## üîß **TESTING METHODS**

### **Method 1: Manual cURL Testing**
```bash
# Test general chat
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"query": "Your test question here"}'

# Test backoffice queries
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/ai/backoffice \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"query": "Show me user statistics"}'
```

### **Method 2: Automated Python Script**
```bash
# Use the provided test script
python test_chatbot_roles.py

# Update tokens in the script first:
# TEST_TOKENS = {
#     "superadmin": "your_superadmin_jwt_token",
#     "admin": "your_admin_jwt_token",
#     "agent": "your_agent_jwt_token", 
#     "user": "your_user_jwt_token"
# }
```

### **Method 3: Frontend Testing**
```bash
# Start frontend application
cd front-backoffice
npm start

# Login with different role accounts
# Navigate to AI chat section
# Test questions through UI
```

## üìä **MONITORING & VERIFICATION**

### **Database Queries to Check Results:**

```sql
-- Check AI usage logs
SELECT 
  u.name, 
  r.name as role, 
  l.query_type, 
  l.access_granted, 
  l.denial_reason,
  l.response_time_ms,
  l.tokens_used,
  l.created_at
FROM ai_usage_logs l
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id  
JOIN roles r ON l.user_role_id = r.id
ORDER BY l.created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Monitor denied access attempts
SELECT 
  u.name, 
  r.name as role, 
  l.denial_reason, 
  COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM ai_usage_logs l
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id
JOIN roles r ON l.user_role_id = r.id  
WHERE l.access_granted = 0
GROUP BY u.id, r.id, l.denial_reason
ORDER BY attempts DESC;

-- Check conversation history
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.conversation_type,
  u.name as user_name,
  COUNT(m.id) as message_count,
  MAX(m.created_at) as last_message
FROM conversations c
JOIN users u ON c.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN conversation_messages m ON c.id = m.conversation_id
GROUP BY c.id
ORDER BY last_message DESC;
```

### **Expected Response Patterns:**

**Successful Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "query": "Your question",
  "response": "AI generated response",
  "conversation_id": "uuid",
  "tokens_used": 150,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

**Access Denied Response:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Access denied: Insufficient privileges for this query",
  "role_limitation": true,
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

## üö® **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Common Issues:**

#### **AI Service Not Responding:**
```bash
# Check if AI service is running
ps aux | grep python
netstat -tlnp | grep 5001

# Restart AI service
cd AI
python main_app.py
```

#### **Authentication Errors:**
```bash
# Verify JWT token is valid
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/auth/verify \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Check token expiration
# Tokens typically expire after 24 hours
```

#### **Database Connection Issues:**
```bash
# Check MySQL connection
mysql -u root -p -e "SELECT 1"

# Verify database schema
mysql -u root -p korpor_dev -e "SHOW TABLES"
```

#### **Permission Issues:**
```sql
-- Check user role assignment
SELECT u.id, u.name, u.email, r.name as role_name 
FROM users u 
LEFT JOIN roles r ON u.role_id = r.id 
WHERE u.email = 'your_email@example.com';

-- Check AI role permissions
SELECT * FROM ai_role_permissions WHERE role_id = YOUR_ROLE_ID;
```

### **Error Codes:**
- **400**: Bad request (missing query parameter)
- **401**: Unauthorized (invalid/expired JWT token)
- **403**: Forbidden (insufficient role permissions)
- **404**: Not found (conversation/user not found)
- **500**: Internal server error
- **503**: AI service unavailable
