# Google Pay Integration Guide

## Overview

We've successfully integrated Google Pay detection and payment functionality into the Korpor mobile app. Users can now use cards saved in their Google Play Store, YouTube, Chrome, or Android device for quick and secure payments.

## ðŸš€ Features Added

### PaymentMethodScreen Integration

- **Automatic Detection**: Detects if Google Pay is available on the device
- **Card Discovery**: Checks for cards saved in Google Play Store and other Google services
- **Setup Flow**: Allows users to save cards from Google Pay for future use
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows Google Pay availability with appropriate UI elements

### InvestmentPaymentScreen Integration

- **Payment Option**: Google Pay appears as a payment method for investments
- **Seamless Flow**: Users can complete investments using Google Pay cards
- **Test Mode Support**: Works with Stripe test environment

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Core Components Used

- `usePlatformPay` hook from `@stripe/stripe-react-native`
- `isPlatformPaySupported` for device capability detection
- `confirmPlatformPaySetupIntent` for saving payment methods
- `confirmPlatformPayPayment` for processing payments
- `PlatformPayButton` for Google Pay UI

### Platform Detection

```typescript
if (Platform.OS === "android") {
  const googlePaySupported = await isPlatformPaySupported({
    googlePay: {
      testEnv: paymentMethods?.stripe.test_mode || true,
    },
  });
  setIsGooglePaySupported(googlePaySupported);
}
```

### Payment Processing

```typescript
const { error } = await confirmPlatformPayPayment(clientSecret, {
  googlePay: {
    testEnv: paymentMethods?.stripe.test_mode || true,
    merchantName: "Korpor",
    merchantCountryCode: "US",
    currencyCode: currency.toUpperCase(),
  },
});
```

## ðŸŽ¯ User Experience

### What Users See

1. **Automatic Detection**: If Google Pay is available, users see a Google Pay option
2. **Card Access**: Google Pay button allows access to cards from:
   - Google Play Store purchases

   - Chrome saved payment methods
   - Android device saved cards

## ðŸ”’ Security & Compliance

### How It Works

- **Tokenization**: Google Pay uses tokenized card data, never exposing real card numbers
- **Device Authentication**: Payments require device unlock (fingerprint, PIN, etc.)

- **No Storage**: Card details are never stored on our servers

### Stripe Integration
