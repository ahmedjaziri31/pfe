## 🔍 **HOW TO TEST**

1. **Create test users for each role** (or use existing ones)
2. **Login with different role accounts**
3. **Ask these questions in the AI chat**
4. **Verify responses match expected access levels**
5. **Check ai_usage_logs table for access attempts**

### **Verification Queries:**
```sql
-- Check what data each role accessed
SELECT u.name, r.name as role, l.query_type, l.access_granted, l.denial_reason
FROM ai_usage_logs l
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id  
JOIN roles r ON l.user_role_id = r.id
ORDER BY l.created_at DESC;

-- Monitor denied access attempts
SELECT u.name, r.name as role, l.denial_reason, COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM ai_usage_logs l
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id
JOIN roles r ON l.user_role_id = r.id  
WHERE l.access_granted = 0
GROUP BY u.id, r.id, l.denial_reason;
```

## 🚨 **RED FLAGS TO WATCH FOR**

- ❌ **Agent seeing approved user data**
- ❌ **Admin accessing passwords/tokens** 
- ❌ **User getting any database results**
- ❌ **Any role seeing data they shouldn't**
- ❌ **SQL injection succeeding**
- ❌ **Role escalation working**

If any of these happen, the security system needs immediate attention!
