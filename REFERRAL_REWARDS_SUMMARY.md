# 🎁 Referral Rewards System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ BOTH PARTIES GET REWARDED

### 👥 Reward Distribution

- **REFERRER** (Person who shares code): Gets reward when friend invests
- **REFEREE** (Person who uses code): Gets reward when account is approved

### 💰 Reward Amounts

| Currency | Referrer Reward | Referee Reward | Min Investment Required |
| -------- | --------------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| **TND**  | 125 TND         | 125 TND        | 2,000 TND               |
| **EUR**  | 50 EUR          | 50 EUR         | 800 EUR                 |

## 🎯 Complete Reward Flow

### Step 1: Referrer Shares Code

- User A gets unique code: `"efe51"`
- Shares via QR, social media, or direct link

### Step 2: Referee Uses Code

- User B signs up with referralCode: `"efe51"`
- System creates pending referral record

### Step 3: Referee Gets Reward (IMMEDIATE)

- Admin approves User B's account
- **User B automatically receives 125 TND/50 EUR**
- Added to User B's `rewardsBalance`
- Referral status: `pending` → `qualified`

### Step 4: Referrer Gets Reward (CONDITIONAL)

- User B makes investment ≥ 2000 TND/800 EUR
- **User A automatically receives 125 TND/50 EUR**
- Added to User A's `rewardsBalance`
- Referral status: `qualified` → `rewarded`

## 🏦 Wallet Display Implementation

### Frontend Wallet Cards

**File**: `front-mobile/src/app/main/components/wallet/compoenets/ui/Carousel.tsx`

The wallet shows **3 separate cards**:

1. **Total Balance Card**

   ```javascript
   amount = cashBalance + rewardsBalance;
   // Shows combined money from all sources
   ```

2. **Cash Balance Card**

   ```javascript
   amount = cashBalance;
   // Available for investments and withdrawals
   ```

3. **Rewards Balance Card** ⭐
   ```javascript
   amount = rewardsBalance;
   // Money earned from referral bonuses
   // Shows with star icons and "Earn rewards" button
   ```

### Backend Wallet Structure

**File**: `backend/src/models/Wallet.js`

```javascript
{
  cashBalance: 1500.00,      // Regular deposits/investments
  rewardsBalance: 125.00,    // Referral bonuses
  totalBalance: 1625.00      // Virtual field: cash + rewards
}
```

### Transaction Records

**File**: `backend/src/services/referralRewardService.js`

```javascript
// Each reward creates a transaction
{
  type: "referral_bonus",
  amount: 125.00,
  balanceType: "rewards",           // Goes to rewardsBalance
  description: "Welcome bonus - Referred by user #1",
  reference: "REF_123"
}
```
