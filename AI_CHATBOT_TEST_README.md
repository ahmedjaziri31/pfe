## üìã **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **Before Testing:**
- [ ] Ensure you have test users for each role (superadmin, admin, agent, user)
- [ ] Verify database connection is working
- [ ] Check AI service is running on correct port
- [ ] Confirm role permissions are set up correctly

### **During Testing:**
- [ ] Test with different user roles
- [ ] Verify responses match expected access levels
- [ ] Check for proper error messages when access is denied
- [ ] Monitor response times and performance
- [ ] Look for any data leakage or security issues

### **After Testing:**

- [ ] Check for any denied access attempts
- [ ] Verify no unauthorized data was accessed
- [ ] Document any issues or unexpected behavior

---

## üîç **VERIFICATION QUERIES**
*Run these SQL queries to verify test results*

```sql
-- Check recent AI usage by role
SELECT u.name, r.name as role, l.query_type, l.access_granted, l.created_at
FROM ai_usage_logs l
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id  
JOIN roles r ON l.user_role_id = r.id
ORDER BY l.created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Monitor denied access attempts
SELECT u.name, r.name as role, l.denial_reason, COUNT(*) as attempts
FROM ai_usage_logs l
JOIN users u ON l.user_id = u.id
JOIN roles r ON l.user_role_id = r.id  
WHERE l.access_granted = 0
GROUP BY u.id, r.id, l.denial_reason
ORDER BY attempts DESC;

-- Check conversation history
SELECT c.id, u.name, c.title, COUNT(m.id) as message_count, c.created_at
FROM conversations c
JOIN users u ON c.user_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN conversation_messages m ON c.id = m.conversation_id
GROUP BY c.id
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC;
```
